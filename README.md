# ü¶ê  Shrimp Gem DAO Protocol  ü¶ê

![test](https://i.imgur.com/nIxmlD1.jpg)

## The Protocol
The whale fights the shrimp, and it has never changed since ancient times. Who said shrimp can't fight big whales? As long as we are united!

Shrimp is a community that gathers all leeks. We share the latest Pump tokens and collectively discuss the latest DeFi technology! Anyone who holds 5% of Shrimp Coins can make a Advanced Pool. All Shrimp Holders will start marketing your token! why? Because we are a group of people who want to fight whales.

## Shrimp strategy
When the new token goes online, the shrimps will give back to the community. After the community votes , we will open a new pool, and the total amount of each pool will be fixed at 30,678 Shrimp. We will use the power of the shrimp community to attract more shrimps.

## Level of ocean
üêã Humpback Whale = 5000 BTC or more  
üêã Whale = 1000 - 5000 BTC  
ü¶à Shark = 500 - 1000 BTC  
üê¨ Dolphin = 100 - 500 BTC  
üê† Fish = 50 - 100 BTC  
üêô Octopus = 10 - 50 BTC  
ü¶Ä Crab = 1 - 10 BTC  
ü¶ê Shrimp = less then 1 BTC (We are here)

## Shirmp Token Info
Total Shrimp CoinÔºö224,746 Shrimp(Should subtract 30,678)  
Genesis Distribution PoolÔºöGenesis Staked pool(Dice, Eth, Cream, YFI, Comp, UNI Pool)  
Genesis Distribution PeriodÔºö2020/08/13 ~ 2020/08/19  

## Advanced Pool Info
For those who own 5% of Shrimp Coins, after the proposal, 5% will be locked in the smart contract for a week. 4% shrimp coins will be refunded to you after the end. 1% shrimp coins will be burned out forever.

## Governance
Governance is entirely dictated by Shrimp holders from the start. Upon deployment, ownership of all Shrimp protocol contracts will be reliquished to the timelocked Governance contract or removed entirely. At the very least, this can be seen as a reference implementation for a truly decentralized protocol.

Anybody with 5% of Shrimp to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new shrimping pool, changing an Advanced Pool fee.

## Audits

None. Contributors have given their best efforts to ensure the security of these contracts, but make no guarantees. It has been spot checked by just a few pairs of eyes. It is a probability - not just a possibility - that there are bugs. That said, minimal changes were made to the staking/distribution contracts that have seen hundreds of millions flow through them via SNX, YFI, and YFI derivatives. The reserve contract is excessively simple as well. We prioritized staked assets' security first and foremost.

The original devs encourage governance to fund a bug bounty/security audit

The token itself is largely based on COMP which have undergone audits - but we made non-trivial changes.


If you feel uncomfortable with these disclousures, don't stake or hold Shrimp. If the community votes to fund an audit, or the community is gifted an audit, there is no assumption that the original devs will be around to implement fixes, and is entirely at their discretion.


## Distribution
Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, Shrimp is being distributed in the spirit of YFI: no premine, no founder shares, no VC interests ‚Äî simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.

The initial distribution of Shrump will be evenly distributed across 6 staking pools: WETH, DICE, CREAM, COMP, YFI, and ETH/SHRIMP Uniswap v2 LP tokens. These pools were chosen intentionally to reach a broad swath of the overall DeFi community, as well as specific communities with a proven commitment to active governance and an understanding of complex tokenomics.
